                <h2 id="big-contentA">This is a device that is used to monitor vital signs of people requiring frequent health monitoring. The research led to two different contexts of use, one of which is an industrial project aimed to be used by community health workers in India. </h2>
                    
                <h2 id="big-contentA">The other outcome caters to self-monitoring of vital signs. Self-monitoring vital signs can be confusing and time-consuming at times due to several reasons like ambiguity of techniques, ability to take multiple readings etc. The design of this device is aimed at reducing the burden of monitoring by keeping the flow of monitoring intact. </h2>

                <h2 id="big-contentA" style="font-style: italic; color: #0f0f10;">Note - This documentation will mainly cover the research of context, applied ergonomics research of both the outcomes. However the design & development of self-monitoring device will be elaborated in detail while the other is under NDA.



                <h1 id="titleA">Understanding the Context</h1>
                <h2 id="big-contentA">Historically, the evolution of computing has focused on improving productivity and augmenting human abilities to perform several
                    tasks faster and more efficiently. The development of interfaces like the Sketchpad marked attempts to integrate computing more deeply into how we function. However, in the present day, rampant use of flat-screen devices have started to shape our relationship with technology poorly. Coupled with any sophisticated technology's historical association with power, the relationship is hampered further. On the other hand, the 'design' of technology has adopted some forms of context-agnostic conventions like 'sitting, seeing, and tapping'. This has started to shape our behaviours and more importantly it has become a cultural artifact. The design of technology  embodies human intentions, aspirations, attitudes, culture and constraints. This positioning helps look at technology not only as peripheral objects that enable but also as phenomena in itself.
