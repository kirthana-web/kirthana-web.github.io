                <h2 id="big-contentA">This is a device that is used to monitor vital signs of people requiring frequent health monitoring. The research led to two different contexts of use, one of which is an industrial project aimed to be used by community health workers in India. </h2>
                    
                <h2 id="big-contentA">The other outcome caters to self-monitoring of vital signs. Self-monitoring vital signs can be confusing and time-consuming at times due to several reasons like ambiguity of techniques, ability to take multiple readings etc. The design of this device is aimed at reducing the burden of monitoring by keeping the flow of monitoring intact. </h2>

                <h2 id="big-contentA" style="font-style: italic; color: #0f0f10;">Note - This documentation will mainly cover the research of context, applied ergonomics research of both the outcomes. However the design & development of self-monitoring device will be elaborated in detail while the other is under NDA.



                <h1 id="titleA">Context</h1>
                <h2 id="big-contentA">Patient Health Monitors serve the purpose of identifying escalated conditions by tracking vital signs in situations of post-operative care, ongoing treatment and critical conditions by providing significant information to healthcare providers.
