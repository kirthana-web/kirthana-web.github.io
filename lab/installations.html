                <h2 id="big-contentA"><i>Make sense of Jaipur’s old city through its tightly knit geography and craft heritage.</i></h2>

                <h2 id="big-contentA">Within the street markets of Jaipur Old City, there is a rich craft heritage which has sustained for ~300 years. The origin of such an aggregation of crafts is rooted in a smart geographical placement within the city. The touchwall is an attempt to present the magnanimity and detail of it.</h2>

                    civility are not new. They’ve existed in several forms reinforcing the desire to
                    control, maintain & live in harmony.
                    Being surveilled lends an individual vulnerable to the thickness of world’s interpretations.
                    While in use as a means of law enforcement, surveillance could
                    become a tool for monitoring, influencing and framing activities.</h2>

                <h2 id="big-contentA">Produced as a part of an academic exercise that required a scaled installation to reflect our learnings around forms, spaces and their inter-relation.
                    The installation reflects absurdity in one’s own life and puts the question of meaning at stake. If a distorted surface can perceive our identity in the most absurd manner, why do we attach meaningful values to our identity? Are we bound by meaning?</h2>
