                <h2 id="big-contentA">This is a series of explorations which investigate how everyday objects (like a cup, tape roll, or desk) can facilitate performing digital tasks. The first phase of the project builds on a foundation for the intent of imagination from relevant literature and ideas. The second phase of the project encompassed design of the experiments based on epistemological and functional foundations of select artifacts. The experiments were then showcased to a group of people followed by a discussion on its potential and nature of engagement and meaning-making.

                <h1 id="titleA">Premise</h1>
                <h2 id="big-contentA">Historically, the evolution of computing has focused on improving productivity and augmenting human abilities to perform several
                    tasks faster and more efficiently. The development of interfaces like the Sketchpad marked attempts to integrate computing more deeply into how we function. However, in the present day, rampant use of flat-screen devices have started to shape our relationship with technology poorly. Coupled with any sophisticated technology's historical association with power, the relationship is hampered further. On the other hand, the 'design' of technology has adopted some forms of context-agnostic conventions like 'sitting, seeing, and tapping'. This has started to shape our behaviours and more importantly it has become a cultural artifact. The design of technology  embodies human intentions, aspirations, attitudes, culture and constraints. This positioning helps look at technology not only as peripheral objects that enable but also as phenomena in itself.
