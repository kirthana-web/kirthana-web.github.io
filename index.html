                <h2 id="big-content">In the past few years, I developed a keen interest in learning the ways of people, technologies, objects & societies. With time, they turned into what I metaphorically refer to as 'optical toys' empowering a variety of viewpoints. After observing the emergence of these tools within, I'm learning to craft them carefully and to work with computers, human perception, agency, accountability and love.'I've spent a good deal of time doing just this. Staring at something for so long that I could see, express and articulate the experience in several ways. My interests in making and HCI are rooted here. During my time at university, I've met and extensively worked with some super skilled and thoughtful peers and mentors.</h2>
